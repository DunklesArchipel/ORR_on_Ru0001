This project contains the evaluated data files for the "Impact of the potential dependent surface adlayer composition on the ORR activity and H2O2 formation on Ru(0001) in acid electrolytes".

The subfolders contain the final figures found in the submitted manuscript (and supporting information).

Among the final PNG, also the SVG files are included which are based on the raw PNG obtained from the data evaluation. The CSV contain the data for the individual traces in the figures, where ***r*** and ***b*** refer to the red and blue curves, respectively.

The YAML files contain the metadata associated with the investigated system, such as the electrolyte composition or the suppliers of the electrodes.

For convenience the CSV and YAML have been packed into a frictionless based [unitpackage](https://echemdb.github.io/unitpackage/) (JSON file).
See example notebook.


Therefore, raw data is not included but can be provided upon request.
